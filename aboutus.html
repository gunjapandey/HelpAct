  <div>
    <p style="color:white;text-shadow: 2px 2px #000000;font-family: cursive;">We live in an era where everything is ‘virtual’. <br>
  Non-profits need to keep up with the changing times so that they don’t become obsolete. Subsequently, NGOs have jumped on the wagon by providing the option of “online volunteering”. Welcome to the new age of volunteering where you can be a part of something bigger from wherever you are.<br>
Our Mission is to bring volunteers and organisations together to share time, skills and passion to promote India's social development. </p>
